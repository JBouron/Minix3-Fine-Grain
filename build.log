WARNING: If your texmf tree does not already contain
         up-to-date versions, you must install
             texinfo.tex and txi-??.tex manually,
         perhaps in TEXMF/tex/texinfo/,
         where TEXMF is a root of your TeX tree.
         See doc/README for some considerations.
         You can run make TEXMF=/your/texmf install-tex to do this.

         You may also need to install epsf.tex and (if you
         use pdftex) pdfcolor.tex in TEXMF/tex/generic/dvips
         and TEXMF/pdftex/plain/misc/pdfcolor.tex respectively,
         if your TeX installation did not include them.
