WARNING: If your texmf tree does not already contain
         up-to-date versions, you must install
             texinfo.tex and txi-??.tex manually,
         perhaps in TEXMF/tex/texinfo/,
         where TEXMF is a root of your TeX tree.
         See doc/README for some considerations.
         You can run make TEXMF=/your/texmf install-tex to do this.

         You may also need to install epsf.tex and (if you
         use pdftex) pdfcolor.tex in TEXMF/tex/generic/dvips
         and TEXMF/pdftex/plain/misc/pdfcolor.tex respectively,
         if your TeX installation did not include them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /minixsources/obj.i386/tooldir.Linux-4.18.5-arch1-1-ARCH-x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
